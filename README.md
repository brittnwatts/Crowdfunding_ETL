# Crowdfunding_ETL

This ReadMe serves to:

   A. Certify that this work is our own:
      
      Lakia White
      
      Brittney Watts
      
   B. Specify code source and its location in the 'crowdfunding_ETL' repository
   
   C. Clarify the reason for the assignment

In this repository, we have completed the deliverable Project 2, "Crowdfunding_ETL" and are implementing our knowledge and skills in the ETL (extract, transform, and load) process. The Crowdfunding data is a collection of sample crowdfunding campaigns where data was assembled to name campaigns, campaign goals, campaign outcomes, and etc. 

The source code is our interpretation of the information we learned with debugging help from UNC Bootcamp portal assistance and online forums. Below is a breakdown of the locations of each element of our assignment:

ETL Challenge:
   Our task was to "practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data."

Our Steps: 

   1. Transform Data from Excel into DataFrames using:
      
      a. Jupyter Notebook
      
      b. Pandas
      
      c. Regular Expression (regex)
      
   2. Create and prepare CSV files to upload into DataBase
      
   3. Use CSV files to create Entity Relation Diagram (ERD) and table schema to:
      
      a. Identify and label Primary Keys
      
      b. Identify and label Foreign Keys
      
      c. Identify and label column data types
            
   4. Upload CSV files into Postgres database
